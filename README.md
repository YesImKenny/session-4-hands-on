## React State Management Hands-On Tutorials


## Hands-On 1

In this hands-on exercise, we will be learning how to utilize state in React component. 
This exercise will contain 3 parts.

# Part 1
We will create state object and initialize it in the constructor.
The state object can have as many properties as we like.

# Part 2
We will read the property value of state object by using the ```this.state.propertyname``` syntax, and render them in the DOM.

# Part 3
We will update some propery value of state object by using the ```this.setState()``` method, in order to trigger re-rendering of component with updated value.

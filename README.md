# Ask Apps Academy - Session 4 Take Home Assignment

### Summary:
In this exercise, you will enhance and add some new feature to the React video player app which we created in session 3

The necessary components and styling for the application has already been provided, but there are several parts of the application logic that don't work yet.

The VideoList component renders a collection of VideoButton components. But currently, it doesn't provide user the ability to change or select a video they want to play. We would like to add that feature by using and updating React State we learnt in Session 4.

## React State Management Hands-On Tutorials


## Hands-On 4

In this hands-on exercise, we will be learning how to create a Redux version of counter app by creating a store, setting up Redux, writting a reducer and so on. 
This exercise will contain 3 parts.

# Part 1
We will create a Redux store, wrap the react app with Provider and setting up Redux.

# Part 2
We will create our Reducer function to tell Redux what our state should look like.

# Part 3
We will create the Counter component, and connect it with Redux store. Then create 3 functions to dispatch 3 types of actions (increase, decrease, and reset) to the store, and render the current count value.

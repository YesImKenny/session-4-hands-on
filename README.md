## React State Management Hands-On Tutorials


## Hands-On 2

In this hands-on exercise, we will be learning how to create a simple React counter app by using state. 
This exercise will contain 3 parts.

# Part 1
We will create state object and initialize it in the constructor.
The state object will store the value for our count.

# Part 2
We will read the current count by using the ```this.state.count```, and display it on the UI.

# Part 3
We will create 3 functions to increase, decrease, and reset the count to initial value by updating the state via setState.
